              <p>The property has been identified as being within a coal mining affected area and
                  as such we recommend that a coal mining report is purchased from the Coal Authority
                  to better understand the implications. Further information can be obtained
                  from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-coal-authority">here</a>.</p>
              <p>The property is an intermediate probability radon area as between 3 to 5% of homes are
                  estimated to be at or above the action level. This does not necessarily mean that
                  the property has high radon or that there is cause for concern. Public Health England
                  advises that homes in affected areas should be tested. For further information

              <h3>Professional Opinion</h3>
              <p>Landmark Information Group have identified the property to be within an area that is at minimal or no risk of flooding.</p>
              <p>The homebuyer may wish to investigate any additional flood risks to the property highlighted on the flood gauges using the online viewer.</p>
              <h3>Flood Defences</h3>
              <p>No river/coastal flood defences have been identified or considered as part of Landmark's overall risk of flooding.</p>
              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Ask the seller and other nearby residents if flooding has historically occurred in the area.
                  If it has, why did it occur, what was the impact and what areas were affected.</li>
              </ol>
              <h3>Insurance</h3>
              <p>Buildings and contents insurance should be available and affordable.
                However, we recommend you obtain buildings and contents insurance terms before exchange of contracts to confirm this.</p>
              <h3>Flood Risk</h3>
              <p>Flood risk is based on probability; to understand more about flood and the information reviewed,
                including flood protection measures, please explore the online viewer or visit the
